        <h4>WHAT WE BELIEVE</h4>
        <p>For us to prepare and inspire the next generation of learners, we need to invest in and equip our teachers to embody the 21st century skills of collaboration, critical thinking, creativity and communication for their curriculum and teaching methodologies. </p>
        <p>Adopting educational technology and modern pedagogy in learning environments must be transformative and inspiring in the way students are engaged in the learning process. </p>

      <h2>    <img src="https://d1aupjwqrojm93.cloudfront.net/b8f00e3f-1514-4005-8015-40bdee9d39f9/images/founder-story.svg">

      The Founder's Story</h2>
      <div class="mobile-collapse"><p>Gertrude Quiros Gregorio comes from a family of educators from the town of Pura in Central Luzon, Philippines. Her mother, Purificacion was a dedicated schoolteacher who made teaching and learning a family affair. Gertrude would look forward to helping out with preparing the classroom, teaching aids, and lesson materials all throughout her elementary years. When she stayed with her Auntie Rose to study in the provincial capital town, Gertrude was exposed to the work of teachers in higher learning, as her aunt was a pillar of the largest technical and vocational institute in the province. This experience and the influence of other family members in education developed her early passion for service in education, and inspired her to create Global Learning Access in her mother's honor.</p>
      
      <p>Gertrude is a firm believer that learning is a multifaceted discipline that can nurture people in a multitude of ways. As a Dean of Foothill College in Silicon Valley, she established the Adaptive Learning Division, and was able to utilize that platform to offer pioneering academic programs and ancillary services for students with diverse learning abilities, veterans and lifelong-learners. Her success led the division to become a leader of its kind among the learning centers in Silicon Valley.</p>
      <p>Not one to dwell in politics, she was nevertheless persuaded to run for an elected position at the New Haven School Board in Northern California which oversaw one of the largest and most diverse school districts in the state. From this role, Gertrude developed a greater sense of responsibility and a broader perspective of how every single decision carries an impact on all stakeholders; most importantly, the child as a learner.</p>
      
      <p>Her dream of giving back to her hometown of Pura through education blossomed into a full scale, nationwide advocacy when the Philippines legislated the transformative K-12 educational system. With inspiration and guidance from then Philippine Consul General Marciano Paynor Jr. and Commercial Counselor Josephine Romero in San Francisco, she brought the precursor of what is now Global Learning Access' CatalystPLUS as the pilot program in partnership with Foothill College and the office of Congresswoman Rachel Arenas in 2013. The program brought together Silicon Valley educational experts to Pangasinan, selectively training 108 teachers and collectively impacting 3,600 teachers in their Division.</p>
      
      <p>"Knowledge isn't power until it is applied." This is no truer today, especially with the challenges that confront the world under this global pandemic, than it was when Dale Carnegie first said it. This adage has guided Gertrude throughout her professional career and journey with GLA.</p>
      
      <p>Gertrude believes it is no longer an option to keep doing things the old way. Innovation and accepting change are now prerequisites for survival. She strongly believes in the power of investing in our teachers, to provide training and professional development and apply the knowledge to be able to create meaningful, relevant and useful learning experiences for their students. Through GLA's effective and empowering programs, Gertrude aspires to pave the way in transforming teaching and learning for generations to come in an ever-changing world.</p>
